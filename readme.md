I live by the moto "trust your gut". I strongly believe we must always trust our intuitions from interating with others, to conducting professional work. 
I was inspired by the Gut project created by the agency Sagmeister & Walsh. I decided to use their image of the word gut to create an interactive graphic. 
After having the image, I played with random and spontaneous movements on the canvas to depict the sensation that trusting your gut is something intuitional and spontaneous.
